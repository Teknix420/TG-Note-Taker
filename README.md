# Unit 11 Express Homework: Note Taker

## Description

My homework assignment was to write the backend side of this homework assignment. I created the server.js file and basically tied everything together. I also added a few lines in the index.js file so that it would automatically refresh the page whenever the save button or a delete button was clicked so that everything would populate their places properly.

## Running the file

Just run the server.js file by using node and then open up your web browser to your local host with port 8080 and it should let you browse around the site. You will be able to save notes, view previously saved notes, and delete notes.
